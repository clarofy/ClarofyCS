The goal of ClarofyCS is to help users interact with the Clarofy API
without the need to convert data into JSON format and packing inside GET
requests.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a session with the
API:

``` r
library(ClarofyCS)
## basic example code
# url <- "SUBSTITUTE-API-URL"
# APIKEY <- "YOUR-API-KEY"
# sessionID <- CreateSession(APIKey = APIKey, url = url)
```
